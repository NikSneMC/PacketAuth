# Fabric/Quilt
For the Fabric / Quilt version of the mod, you need to have the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) / [Quilt loader](https://quiltmc.org/install/) installed on your client / server.
<br>
Then copy the [Packet Auth mod](https://modrinth.com/plugin/packetauth/versions?l=fabric) to the mods folder. The mods folder is located in `/mods`.

# Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/Purpur/Folia/BungeeCord/WaterFall
Make sure you put the [Packet Auth plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/packetauth/versions?l=bukkit) jar into the `/plugins` folder of your server or proxy.

# Notes: 
1. **You need [mod](#fabricquilt) installed on your client!**
2. **No need to install the plugin on network servers when using the BungeeCord/WaterFall version!**
